             <p>Open source software is ubiquitous – all across the stack, in the cloud and on-premise, 
             on all devices, in commercial and non-commercial offerings. This success, the dependency 
             of the software industry on open source, combined with recent data breaches and attacks, 
             puts security into the spotlight. This talk will provide an overview - for sure opinionated, 
             hopefully controversial – about the state of affairs and current trends regarding the security 
             of software supply chains, both from consumer and producer perspective.</p>

    - name: Securing low power device communication in a water management use case – Feedback on the Brain-IoT project
      presenter: Paul-Emmanuel Brun, Airbus Cybersecurity
      type: keynote
      time: 9:00 - 9:20
      abstract: |
             <p>In this keynote, we will present an overview of a secure IoT data transmission ecosystem. 
             This overview will be completed with a concrete example of a water management use case from 
             the Brain-IoT project. In this use case, to ensure high trust in the device’s data, we integrated
             an end-to-end security layer that is compatible with battery-less devices with high constraints 
             in terms of energy, power computation and bandwidth.</p>
