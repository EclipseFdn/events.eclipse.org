    - name: 'Cobbles and Potholes – On the Bumpy Road to Secure Software Supply Chains'
      presenter: Henrik Plate, SAP

             <p>Open source software is ubiquitous – all across the stack, in the cloud and on-premise, 
             on all devices, in commercial and non-commercial offerings. This success, the dependency 
             of the software industry on open source, combined with recent data breaches and attacks, 
             puts security into the spotlight. This talk will provide an overview - for sure opinionated, 
             hopefully controversial – about the state of affairs and current trends regarding the security 
             of software supply chains, both from consumer and producer perspective.</p>

      presenter: Salim Chehida, UGA
      type: session
      time: 13:40 - 14:00
      abstract: <p>Security is one of the crucial challenges in the design and development of IoT applications. 
      			This paper presents an approach that focuses on existing security standards to evaluate and 
      			analyse the potential risks faced by IoT systems. It begins by identifying system assets and 
      			their associated vulnerabilities and threats. A list of security objectives and technical 
      			requirements are then defined to mitigate the risks and build a secure and safe system. 
      			We use our approach to assess risks in the robotic system for supporting the movement of loads 
      			in a warehouse.</p>

      type: session
      time: 14:00 - 14:20
      abstract: <p>The CHARIOT H2020 (IoT) project (Cognitive Heterogeneous Architecture for Industrial IoT), 
      			integrates a state-of-the-art inclusive solution for the security, safety and privacy 
      			assurance of data in industrial networks. The solution is based on an integrated approach 
      			for IoT devices lifecycle management (based on blockchain and public key infrastructure 
      			technologies), IoT firmware development and deployment (source and binary level vulnerability 
      			analyses), data analytics (privacy by design, sensitive data detection, dynamic network 
      			configurations etc.) and a set of user interfaces for management and control of the network, 
      			devices and the CHARIOT platform. CHARIOT is funded by the H2020 programme under the IoT topic, 
      			has a 3-year duration and concludes its activities by the end of 2020.</p>

      presenter: Raimundas Savukynas, Vilniaus Universitetas
      type: session
      time: 14:30 - 14:50
      abstract: <p>The launching and linking process of heterogeneous objects to the Internet of Things (IoT) is 
      			related to some important problems of the identification, authentication for ensuring security 
      			over the wireless connections. This research study is related to the implementation of safeguard 
      			algorithms on the first stages of object identification and authentication before the permission 
      			stage for launching into the working area of the IoT. This research aims to evaluate some safety 
      			means related to the identification and authentication stages of objects by integrating them with 
      			the functionality of blockchain. The objectives of this research are related to the development of 
      			more safety working algorithms by representing the stages of checking the identity of the IoT objects. 
      			The results demonstrated integration possibilities of implementing the blockchain functionality for 
      			establishing and managing the operational rules for pre-connection stages of objects to the IoT. 
      			The paper shows new results of developing protection means for ensuring reliable communication in 
      			the transmission of outgoing confidential data and transmission data integrity from smart devices. 
      			As a result, components of necessary functional capabilities of the communication of IoT are developed 
      			by intending to ensure the safety and reliability of the wireless connection of smart objects.</p>

      time: 14:50 - 15:10
      abstract: <p>Norms and standards define the ecosystem in which IoT solutions and developed and deployed. 
      			It is often difficult for people without a legal training or an understanding of standardization 
      			dynamics the fully grasp the state of the art in this very relevant field. This contributions aims 
      			at highlighting the most relevant tools available and explain their relevance.</p>

    - name: Securing low power device communication in a water management use case – Feedback on the Brain-IoT project
      presenter: Paul-Emmanuel Brun, Airbus Cybersecurity
      type: keynote
      time: 9:00 - 9:20
      abstract: |
             <p>In this keynote, we will present an overview of a secure IoT data transmission ecosystem. 
             This overview will be completed with a concrete example of a water management use case from 
             the Brain-IoT project. In this use case, to ensure high trust in the device’s data, we integrated
             an end-to-end security layer that is compatible with battery-less devices with high constraints 
             in terms of energy, power computation and bandwidth.</p>
