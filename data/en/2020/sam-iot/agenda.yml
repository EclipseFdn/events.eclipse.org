             <p>Open source software is ubiquitous – all across the stack, in the cloud and on-premise, 
             on all devices, in commercial and non-commercial offerings. This success, the dependency 
             of the software industry on open source, combined with recent data breaches and attacks, 
             puts security into the spotlight. This talk will provide an overview - for sure opinionated, 
             hopefully controversial – about the state of affairs and current trends regarding the security 
             of software supply chains, both from consumer and producer perspective.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> Security is one of the crucial challenges in the design and development of IoT applications. 
             This paper presents an approach that focuses on existing security standards to evaluate and 
             analyse the potential risks faced by IoT systems. It begins by identifying system assets and 
             their associated vulnerabilities and threats. A list of security objectives and technical 
             requirements are then defined to mitigate the risks and build a secure and safe system. 
             We use our approach to assess risks in the robotic system for supporting the movement of loads 
             in a warehouse.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> The CHARIOT H2020 (IoT) project (Cognitive Heterogeneous Architecture for Industrial IoT), 
             integrates a state-of-the-art inclusive solution for the security, safety and privacy 
             assurance of data in industrial networks. The solution is based on an integrated approach 
             for IoT devices lifecycle management (based on blockchain and public key infrastructure 
             technologies), IoT firmware development and deployment (source and binary level vulnerability 
             analyses), data analytics (privacy by design, sensitive data detection, dynamic network 
             configurations etc.) and a set of user interfaces for management and control of the network, 
             devices and the CHARIOT platform. CHARIOT is funded by the H2020 programme under the IoT topic, 
             has a 3-year duration and concludes its activities by the end of 2020.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> The nowadays industrial digital revolution demands for software driven solutions where 
             reconfiguration is one of the key enablers to achieve smart manufacturing by easy deployment and code 
             reuse. Despite existing several tools and platforms that allow for software reconfiguration at the digital 
             twin / edge level, it is most of the times difficult to make use of state of the art algorithms developed 
             in the most popular programming languages due to software incompatibility. This paper presents a novel 
             framework named Dynamic INtelligent Architecture for Software MOdular REconfiguration (DINASORE) that 
             implements the industrial standard IEC 61499 based in Function Blocks (FB) in Python language for 
             Cyber-Physical Production Systems' implementation. It adopts the 4DIAC-IDE as graphical user interface (GUI) 
             to ease the design and deployment of FBs to quickly and on-demand reconfigure target equipment. The proposed 
             framework provides data integration to third party platforms through the use of OPC-UA. The test scenarios 
             demonstrate that the proposed framework 1) is flexible and reliable for different applications and 2) linear 
             increases the CPU and memory workload for a large amount of FBs.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> The design and development of interconnected industrial production facilities, which integrate aspects 
             of theInternet of Things (IoT) or, more specifically, the IndustrialIoT (IIoT) often deals with complex scenarios 
             involving dynamicSystem of Systems (SoS), resulting in large development anddeployment efforts. The Arrowhead 
             community aims at deliv-ering mechanisms and technologies to cope with such complexscenarios. In particular, the 
             concepts of local clouds providing aservice-oriented architecture (SOA) framework for IIoT. Here,a central 
             challenge is the conceptual modeling of such use-cases. SysML is widely established as a standardized modeling 
             language and framework for large-scale systems engineeringand, thus, for Arrowhead local cloud designs. However, 
             SysMLand its Arrowhead profile lacks a canonical way to supportactual platform modeling and device involvement 
             in heavilydistributed IIoT scenarios. The Eclipse Vorto project is ideal forfilling this gap: it provides a 
             modeling language for IoT devicesand comes with a set of modeling tools and already existingreusable templates 
             of device models. In this paper, we proposean approach to integrating Eclipse Vorto models into ArrowheadSysML 
             models. We illustrate the concept with a realistic, yetcomprehensible industrial scenario and also present a 
             prototypeto emphasize the benefits of our novel integration platform.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> Internet of Things (IoT) is a pervasive technology covering many applications areas (Smart Mobility, 
             Smart Industry, Smart Healthcare, Smart Building, etc.). Its success and the technology evolution allow targeting 
             more complex and critical applications such as the management of critical infrastructures and cooperative service 
             robotics, which requires real time operation and a higher level of intelligence in the monitoring-control command 
             for decision-making. Furthermore, these applications type need to be fully validated in advance considering that bugs 
             discovered during real operation could cause significant damages. In order to avoid these drawbacks, IoT developers 
             and system integrators need advanced tools and methodologies. This paper presents a methodology and a set of tools, 
             defined and developed in the context of the BRAIN-IoT European Union (EU) project. The overall framework includes both 
             Open semantic models to enforce interoperable operations and exchange of data and control features; and Model-based 
             development tools to implement Digital Twin solutions to facilitate the prototyping and integration of interoperable 
             and reliable IoT system solutions. After describing the solution developed, this paper also presents concrete use cases 
             based on the two critical systems mentioned above, leveraging the application scenarios used to validate the concepts 
             developed and results obtained by the BRAIN-IoT project.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> Thanks to Building Energy and Comfort Managements (BECM) systems, it is possible monitor and control 
             buildings with the aim to ease appliance management and at the same time ensuring efficient use of them from the 
             energetic point of view. To develop such kind of systems, it is necessary to monitor users' habits, learning their 
             preferences and predicting their sequences of performed activities and appliance usage during the day. To this aim, 
             in this paper a system capable of controlling home appliances according to user preferences and trying to reduce 
             energy consumption is proposed. The main objective of the system is to learn users' daily behaviour and to be able 
             to predict their future activities basing on statistical data about the activities they usually perform. The system 
             can then execute a scheduling algorithm of the appliances based on the expected energy consumption and user 
             annoyance related with shifting the appliance starting time from their preferred one. Experimental results 
             demonstrate that thanks to the scheduling algorithm energy cost can be reduced of 50.43% and 49.2% depending on 
             different tariffs, just by shifting the use of the appliance to time periods of non-peak hours. Scheduling based on 
             probability evaluation of preferred time of usage of the appliances allows to still obtain evident energy savings 
             even considering the errors on predicted activities.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> The current market is dynamic and, consequently, industries need to be able to meet unpredictable market 
             changes in order to remain competitive. To address the change in paradigm, from mass production to mass customization, 
             manufacturing flexibility is key. Moreover, current digitalization of the industry opens opportunities regarding 
             real-time decision support systems allowing the companies to make strategic decisions, and gain competitive advantage 
             and business value. The main focus of this paper is to demonstrate a proof of concept Prescriptive System applied to 
             Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems. This system is capable of suggesting sequences of machines throughputs that best 
             balance productivity, and the impact of the proposed throughput in the degradation of the equipment. The proposed 
             solution is mainly composed of two modules, namely manufacturing environment simulation and optimizer. The simulation 
             module is modeled based on Directed Acyclic Graphs and the second one on Genetic Algorithms. The results were evaluated 
             against two metrics, variation of pieces referred as differential and availability of the system. Analysis of the results 
             show that productivity in all testing scenarios improves, and in some instances, availability slightly increases showing 
             promising indicators. However, further research should be conducted to be able to generalize the obtained results.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, one of the main research topics in the context of application of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) in the Smart 
             City and Industry 4.0 scenarios is the one related to the use of Robot Operating System (ROS)-based CPS. Specifically, one 
             of the main interest is to allow a ROS-based smart robot needs to communicate with other heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) 
             applications in an intelligent environment to efficiently react to the system requirements and environment changes. However, the 
             communication between the IoT systems will face many challenges and increase the cost and risks that lead to the requirement of 
             a cross-platform communication for bridging the ROS-based CPS and other heterogeneous IoT applications. This paper introduces 
             an OSGi-based adaptor, named the ROS Edge Node, for the interoperability between Robotics domain and other IoT domains, leveraging 
             the highly modular BRAIN-IoT federation, which allows to decentralize, composite and dynamically federate the heterogeneous IoT 
             platforms by leveraging OSGi. Together with the unfixed infrastructure of BRAIN-IoT solution, the event-driven asynchronous 
             communication mechanism realizes cross-platform interaction with ROS-based CPS and solves the major challenges faced. The ROS 
             Edge Node is packaged as a BRAIN-IoT Service with Requirement/Capability in metadata, similar to microservice, to be deployed 
             in a distributed BRAIN-IoT Fabric cluster as a bridge between the underlying ROS-based robotics systems and other OSGi-based 
             IoT systems in various IoT domains via an Asynchronous Eventing Substrate (BRAIN-IoT EventBus). This paper demonstrates the 
             solution developed in an service robotics use case in a warehouse to show how the OSGi-based adaptor enables the fast adaptivity 
             and interoperability between heterogeneous IoT domains in a federated environment.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> Nowadays competitiveness goes through several aspects: digitalization, productivity, environmental impact. Technology is 
             advancing fast and helping industries to obtain more and more detailed data. In fact, the possibility to monitoring and control 
             each part of the process is a strong base on which can be build a more intelligent and focused control. Technology advance brings 
             innovation and possibility to manage the production in terms of "near future" through AI prediction and decision-making support. 
             Forecasting demands and productions, optimizing process by reducing costs and improving efficiency without corrupting the quality 
             of the product is a big challenge at the plants level. Automation, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), robotics, cloud computing, 
             AI and more... A problem arises for the industries in the time of researching, getting approval, purchasing and installing new technology, 
             in fact, a faster and better solution may have already emerged. In this paper, a flexible, scalable and fast solution has been proposed 
             to cope such problem and help industries to advance and discover possible optimizations.</p>

             <strong>Abstract:</strong> The presented paper describes the design and validation of the hierarchical intrusion detection system (IDS), which combines 
             machine learning approach with the knowledge-based methods. As the knowledge model, we have proposed the ontology of network attacks, 
             which allow to us decompose detection and classification of the existing types of attacks or formalize detection rules for the new types. 
             Designed IDS was evaluated on a widely used KDD 99 dataset and compared to similar approaches.</p>
