    bio: |
      <p>Henrik Plate is a senior researcher at SAP Security Research [1, 2, 3, 4].
      He received his MSc in Computer Science and Business Administration in 1999 
      from the University of Mannheim. His current research focusses on the security 
      of software supply chains, esp. the use of open source components with known 
      vulnerabilities and supply chain attacks. He is a co-author of Eclipse Steady [5], 
      which supports the detection, assessment and mitigation of vulnerable open source 
      dependencies in Java and Python applications. </p>

      <p><strong>Keynote</strong>: Cobbles and Potholes – On the Bumpy Road to Secure Software Supply Chains</p>
      <p>Open source software is ubiquitous – all across the stack, in the cloud and on-premise, on all devices, 
      in commercial and non-commercial offerings. This success, the dependency of the software industry on open source, 
      combined with recent data breaches and attacks, puts security into the spotlight. This talk will provide an overview - 
      for sure opinionated, hopefully controversial – about the state of affairs and current trends regarding the security 
      of software supply chains, both from consumer and producer perspective.</p>

      <p><strong>Keynote</strong>: Securing low power device communication in a water management use case – Feedback on the Brain-IoT project</p>
      <p>In this keynote, we will present an overview of a secure IoT data transmission ecosystem. This overview will be completed with a concrete
      example of a water management use case from the Brain-IoT project. In this use case, to ensure high trust in the device’s data, we integrated
      an end-to-end security layer that is compatible with battery-less devices with high constraints in terms of energy, power computation and bandwidth.</p>
