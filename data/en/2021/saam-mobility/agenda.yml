            <p>Our world is changing, and the change is visible everywhere. More than 50% of the population is living in
            cities and the cities are growing. More and more goods and people need to be transported, bringing the
            traffic infrastructure to its limits. Increasing pollution and noise levels bringing the environment to its
            limits. <br/>
            To counter this, a transformation of the mobility is needed, who has already started, powered by new
            technologies and services. The mobility of the future will be electrified, connected, personalized,
            automated and software defined.<br/>
            Software is more and more dominating our daily life, also in the automotive world. Almost every
            function in the vehicle is defined by software. Autonomous Driving solutions introduce a new complexity
            into the development of embedded systems in the vehicle. This complexity rises with each level of
            control and autonomy of the automated driving systems and you need deeper expertise and more
            software. Software is more and more becoming an important differentiator for autonomous vehicles.
            Increasing embedded software complexity with an increase in level of automation is putting new
            demands on the existing tools and frameworks. Instead of solving these challenges alone, partnering in
            non-differentiating areas and collaborating is the path forward.</p>

            Humans are very good at adapting to and driving in very different conditions and environments.  
            Complex AI based software such as Autonomous vehicles (AV) are biased by the training data and 
            they do not do well in different contexts. Environment perception and context awareness can be 
            used to adapt and deploy complex networks of AI systems that are expected to perform safely on 
            many different environments and edge cases. Typical Autonomous Drive (AD) software stacks provide 
            localization, object detection and tracking using an array of sensor data. Additional sources of 
            information such as V2X connectivity, passenger behavior, person-to-device mapping, urban context, 
            degradation of traffic etc. complements the sensor data that can be used to describe a context. This 
            ontext is used to predict and adapt the system of software and applications that are deployed to the 
            vehicle.<br/>
            Context Aware Software Stack for Mobility (CASSM) describes a model based approach for definition of a 
            oftware stack for complex systems such as those found in autonomous vehicles.  Machine Learning is used 
            to detect a context and adapt the software stack, which can then be used to identify and deploy services 
            to autonomous vehicles. CASSM will be an open source in-vehicle delivery of context-driven services and 
            applications. This paper describes an architecture to define context-aware personalized & dynamically 
            provisioned capabilities, applications & services to autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>Authors: Anand Prakash, Lukas Krawczyk and Carsten Wolff<br/>
            The computational demands of safety critical ADAS applications on autonomous vehicles have been ever-increasing. 
            As a result, high performance computing nodes with varying operating frequencies, and inclusion of different sensors have 
            been introduced, which has resulted in introduction of heterogeneous architectures with high complexity.  This complexity 
            has led to challenges in analysing a system’s timing behavior, such as determining the end-to-end response time of 
            high-level functionality as well as a real-time application’s latency. The existing approaches in analysing the timing 
            behavior of an ADAS application does not address the overall end-to-end response time. It is also worth mentioning that 
            a practical timing verification of an ADAS in a real-life scenario is still an open issue. <br/>
            This talk provides an overview of the existing RC car platforms along with its comparison to the proposed RC car 
            demonstrator platform. It focuses on the model based architectural design of RC car demonstrator as well as the 
            event-chain task model, which is coarsely based on Waters Challenge 2019. Further, it lays emphasis on deriving 
            the timing parameter metrics from the generated trace file, which can be used to evaluate the system behavior 
            against the timing requirements. Finally, the talk concludes with the importance on designing an ADAS with a 
            model-based approach. This will enable a better, faster and modular analysis of a safety critical ADAS application.</p>

            The complexity of heterogeneous embedded systems as well as the introduction of AI-based functions to realize ADAS 
            or autonomous driving features pose new challenges for the safety assessment process. In this demo, we illustrate 
            the analysis of a complex system in terms of function safety (ISO 26262) and Safety Of The Intended Functionality 
            (SOTIF, ISO 21448) with the model-based Component Fault Tree (CFT) methodology using a self-driving toy vehicle 
            (the PANORover).</p>

            <p>Author: Mikko Rajanen <br/>This paper proposes a list of potential benefits of better usability and user experience 
            adapted to automated driving and autonomous mobility. These benefits could be useful for understanding and communicating 
            the importance of usability and user experience for the success of automated driving to be accepted by the non-technical 
            public and becoming mainstream and successful. In this paper, the focus is on identifying usability and user experience 
            benefits of human-machine interaction (HMI) in automated driving context. The goal of the paper is to legitimize the 
            usability and the user experience activities in the eyes of the management of automated driving application and HMI 
            development organizations. The user-centered design process focuses on users, their needs and requirements. This paper 
            shows that the benefits of better usability and user experience through user-centered design can be identified in use 
            context as well as application development context through competitive advantage, reduced risks, and reduced development 
            costs.</p>

    type: keynote
    time: 9:10 - 9:40
    abstract: |
            <p>The mobility landscape is undergoing significant changes. More and more mobility providers compete
            for customers with their own mobility services. Traditional public transport, demand responsive transport, 
            taxis, car sharing, ride pooling, bike sharing, e-scooters,  … the available modes of transport in cities 
            are becoming increasingly heterogeneous and confusing. At the same time, significant changes to the landscape 
            are induced by the effects of the global pandemic. They may lead to even more drastic changes in the mobility 
            demand.</p>
            <p>How to tame the complexity of this landscape and fight the climate change without neglecting mobility as a 
            fundamental human need is an open - albeit essential - question.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we will examine the changes in the mobility landscape and look at the role of two important 
            players in this discussion: open simulators and artificial intelligence. What do they bring to the table 
            in order to tackle the rising complexity? How can they be applied to improve the transportation system in 
            a city? The Eclipse SUMO project is used as an example to illustrate how to build digital twins of smart cities. 
            Moreover, results from recent research projects are used to discuss the effectiveness and efficiency of applying 
            artificial intelligence to optimize transportation systems.</p>
