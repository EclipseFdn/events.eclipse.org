             <p>Our world is changing, and the change is visible everywhere. More than 50% of the population is living in
              cities and the cities are growing. More and more goods and people need to be transported, bringing the
              traffic infrastructure to its limits. Increasing pollution and noise levels bringing the environment to its
              limits. <br/>
              To counter this, a transformation of the mobility is needed, who has already started, powered by new
              technologies and services. The mobility of the future will be electrified, connected, personalized,
              automated and software defined.<br/>
              Software is more and more dominating our daily life, also in the automotive world. Almost every
              function in the vehicle is defined by software. Autonomous Driving solutions introduce a new complexity
              into the development of embedded systems in the vehicle. This complexity rises with each level of
              control and autonomy of the automated driving systems and you need deeper expertise and more
              software. Software is more and more becoming an important differentiator for autonomous vehicles.
              Increasing embedded software complexity with an increase in level of automation is putting new
              demands on the existing tools and frameworks. Instead of solving these challenges alone, partnering in
              non-differentiating areas and collaborating is the path forward.</p>
