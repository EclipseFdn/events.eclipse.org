Missing your event on this site? Please submit your event to the [Eclipse Newsroom](https://newsroom.eclipse.org/node/add/events).

Eclipse Foundation Staff can request an Event website similar to [Open Source AI Workshop](https://events.eclipse.org/2020/open-source-ai-workshop/) by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/events.eclipse.org/issues/new?template=event.md). 

The Eclipse Foundation Webdev team will start working on your request once the [Event Website Content Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVLBK8tzyuYC9OUisy1x-cc50PfGx0alnUHw9RYlZag) is completed and uploaded to your issue.

Please plan for a minimum of two weeks for the website implementation. Additional information is available in the [Event Website Content Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVLBK8tzyuYC9OUisy1x-cc50PfGx0alnUHw9RYlZag) document.
