**SAM IoT is the first virtual Eclipse Conference on Security, Artificial Intelligence, and Modeling for the next generation Internet of Things**
## Background  

The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) is drastically increasing in every application domain, contributing to the rapid digitalization of contemporary society. Current IoT scenarios are characterized by constantly increasing demands in terms of non-functional requirements, from low latency to high reliability, dependability, and dynamic resources allocation. This paradigm shift, also considered as the next evolutionary phase of IoT, is expected to create numerous opportunities for the technology market supporting applications in multiple areas, i.e. Smart Factories, Smart Cities, Critical Infrastructures, Cooperative Service Robotics, etc. To cope with these demanding requirements, a multitude of novel technologies - such as Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Analytics, Digital Twin, as well as Security, Privacy and Trust schemes – are being investigated in order to be adopted in current IoT architectures standards, identifying efficient integration schemes with proper design patterns. Hence, designing and managing the next generation of IoT-based systems is set to become even more complex.

## Call for Papers  

The Eclipse SAM IoT conference will bring together industry experts and researchers working on the next generation IoT, especially focussing on Security and Privacy, Artificial Intelligence, and Modelling.  You will be invited to present your results to participants from the research community, industry and standardisation bodies and to exchange ideas for future joint research activities. We welcome all submissions and do not require projects to be associated with the Eclipse Foundation or its projects. Final date for submissions is July 22, 2020. Selected papers will be published under the Creative Commons License 4.0 on [ceur-ws.org](http://ceur-ws.org).

## Submission Guidelines  

Final submissions must not substantially overlap papers previously or simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. The contents should be written in English with a maximum length of eight (8) printed pages. More details are available in the following subsections. The Eclipse Foundation reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.

### Instructions

* Authors are invited to electronically submit full regular papers on their work. English is the working language of the Conference. Papers are limited to eight (8) pages.
* Papers must be written in a two-column format. It is strongly recommended to use the IEEE A4 templates that is available on the IEEE site.  [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
* The author must submit a draft version of the paper for review before the submission deadline (see Important Dates above). Drafts are submitted through the EDAS Submission System. 
* Papers should be submitted under a specific topic of interest and must contain only original work, not previously published or copyrighted. Authors are expected to submit only their own original works. 
* Authors are expected to give a short presentation of their work at the SAM IoT conference. 
* Accepted and presented papers will be published in conference proceedings under the Creative Commons License 4.0 on [ceur-ws.org](http://ceur-ws.org).
