# events.eclipse.org

The [events.eclipse.org](https://events.eclipse.org) website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

The site provides date, time and place for the various events (conferences, demo camps, special days, hackathons and trainings) for the Eclipse ecosystem, displayed on a convenient map of the world.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/events.eclipse.org.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eclipsefdn/events.eclipse.org) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8d42015f-09c7-46b1-9f9c-419404d01f6d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/eclipsefdn/deploys)

## Getting started

Install dependencies, build assets and start a webserver:

```bash
npm install 
hugo server
```

## Copy and edit template for new event entries in the JSON File

file location: static/data/EclipseEvents.json

Copy text below and insert into JSON file 
If you insert the last entry in the file, ommit the trailing comma

Replace the second part of each pair with the appropriate information, 

Look up the geo data (longitude and latitude) based on the address. You can use for example this [geocoder](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocode)

To help us, please use the "MMM DD, YYYY" format for the "date" fields. Example: "Nov 3, 2013" will work just fine! <br>
We hope to find a more general solution in the future.We are not using the time for anything (yet), so feel free to add the time in any format that is appropriate.
